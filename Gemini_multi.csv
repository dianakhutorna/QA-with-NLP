When does the contact person wish to receive a follow up?,"During our conversation,  Mr. Henderson mentioned he's swamped this week with a major client deadline.  He seemed more relaxed when discussing his schedule for the following two weeks,  and even brought up having some time then to review proposals.  While he didn't explicitly state a preference, his comments strongly suggested that a follow-up within two weeks would be ideal,  allowing him to deal with his immediate priorities before engaging with ours.  A three-week timeframe felt too long given our earlier discussion of his interest.","['1 week', '2 weeks', '3 weeks']",['2 weeks']
Which kind of follow up is planned with your contact?,"He mentioned being swamped with emails,  so a phone call would be better to get his immediate attention and gauge his interest more efficiently.  A follow-up email summarizing our conversation and including the brochure would be good reinforcement afterwards, but the phone call is the priority.
